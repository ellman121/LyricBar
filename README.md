## FAQ

### The icon is pixelated
Yeah, I know.  I just couldn't be bothered to create a high-res enough asset for it becuase I'm still not sure I like the L.  If you have an idea for an image feel free to submit a PR with it.  I'm open to suggestions

### Your code is garbage
I know.  I'm not a swift developer by traiing, I just threw this together in my free time.  If you have code feedback (wether my stuff isn't conventional, inefficient, etc.) please submit a PR.  I'm just trying to learn some new stuff with this app.

### Why doesn't it do ___
I made this so that I could look up the lyrics to the song I'm listening to  while working.  But if you want features, please build it and submit a PR, I will gladly merge things that are of value!

### Is there anything I can do for you, ellman121 senpai?
The app is completely free to use, and I ask nothing in return.  If you feel so inclined, you can [buy me a beer](https://paypal.me/ellman121).  I'm also always looking for feedback on my code (I'm not the worlds greatest macOS developer, so any feedback is appreciated)
